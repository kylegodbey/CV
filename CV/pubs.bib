	abstract = {Quantum shell effects drive many aspects of many-body quantal systems and their interactions. Among these are the quasifission reactions that impede the formation of a compound nucleus in superheavy element (SHE) searches. Fragment production in quasifission is influenced by shell effects as a nontrivial manifestation of microscopic dynamics hindering the full equilibration of the composite system to form the compound nucleus. In this Letter, we use the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory to study 48Ca+249Bk collisions to investigate the influence of the tensor component of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. The results show that the inclusion of the tensor force causes the spherical shell effect to become more prominent, particularly for the neutron number yield whose peak is exactly at magic number N=126. This suggests that the tensor force plays a compelling role in the evolution of dynamical shell effects in nuclear reactions, influencing the competition between spherical and deformed shell gaps.}

By fitting the density dependence of the Δ resonance production cross section in nuclear medium to reproduce the experimental π± multiplicities measured by the HADES Collaboration, we obtain a good description of the rapidity distributions and transverse momentum spectra of π± in collisions at various centralities. Some shortcomings in the description of π± production may indicate the need for including the strong potential on π± in RVUU, which is at present absent. We also calculate the proton rapidity distribution in the most central collisions and compare with the coalescence invariant proton rapidity distribution extracted from preliminary HADES data.}

ABSTRACT={In the search for superheavy elements quasifission reactions represent one of the reaction pathways that curtail the formation of an evaporation residue. In addition to its importance in these searches quasifission is also an interesting dynamic process that could assist our understanding of many-body dynamical shell effects and energy dissipation thus forming a gateway between deep-inelastic reactions and fission. This manuscript gives a summary of recent progress in microscopic calculations of quasifission employing time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and its extensions.}
